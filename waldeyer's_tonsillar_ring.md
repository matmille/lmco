**Waldeyer's tonsillar ring** (**pharyngeal lymphoid ring**,
**Waldeyer's lymphatic ring**, or **tonsillar ring**) is a ringed
arrangement of [lymphoid organs](Lymphatic_system "wikilink") in the
[pharynx](human_pharynx "wikilink"). Waldeyer's ring surrounds the
[naso-](nasopharynx "wikilink") and [oropharynx](oropharynx "wikilink"),
with some of its tonsillar tissue located above and some below the [soft
palate](soft_palate "wikilink") (and to the back of the [mouth
cavity](oral_cavity "wikilink")).

## Structure

The ring consists of the (from top to bottom):

-   1 [pharyngeal tonsil](pharyngeal_tonsil "wikilink") (or "adenoid"),
    located on the roof of the nasopharynx, under the sphenoid bone.
-   2 [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsil "wikilink") on each side, where each
    [auditory tube](auditory_tube "wikilink") opens into the nasopharynx
-   2 [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink") (commonly called
    "the tonsils") located in the oropharynx
-   [lingual tonsils](lingual_tonsil "wikilink"), a collection of
    lymphatic tissue located on the back part of the
    [tongue](tongue "wikilink")

### Terminology

Some authors speak of two pharyngeal tonsils/two adenoids. These authors
simply look at the left and right halves of the pharyngeal tonsil as two
tonsils. Many authors also speak of lingual tonsils (in the plural),
because this accumulation of lymphoid tissue consists of a number of
little prominences – many smaller rounded masses. Whether to
collectively call all these a single tonsil or separate tonsils is to an
extent an arbitrary decision.

### Variation

There also normally is a good amount of
[mucosa](mucosa "wikilink")-associated [lymphoid
tissue](lymphoid_tissue "wikilink")
([MALT](Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue "wikilink")) present between
all these tonsils (intertonsillar) around the ring, and more of this
lymphoid tissue can variably be found more or less throughout at least
the naso- and oropharynx.

### Development

The tubal tonsils usually develop from an accumulation of lymphoid
tissue in the pharyngeal tonsil.

## Clinical significance

The [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink") when
inflamed/swollen, more common in children, can obstruct respiration.[1]

Inflammation of the tonsils is called
[tonsillitis](tonsillitis "wikilink") and removal is called
[tonsillectomy](tonsillectomy "wikilink").[2]

## Etymology of Waldeyer's ring

Waldeyer's ring was named after the nineteenth-century
[German](Germans "wikilink") [anatomist](Anatomy "wikilink") [Heinrich
Wilhelm Gottfried von
Waldeyer-Hartz](Heinrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_von_Waldeyer-Hartz "wikilink").[3]

## Other animals

Some animals, but not humans, have one or two additional tonsils:

-   Soft palate tonsil
-   Paraepiglottic tonsil

In [anatomy](anatomy "wikilink"), the **pharyngeal tonsil**, also known
as the **nasopharyngeal tonsil** or **adenoid**, is the
[superior](anatomical_terms_of_location#Superior_and_inferior "wikilink")-most
of the [tonsils](tonsil "wikilink"). It is a mass of [lymphatic
tissue](Lymphatic_tissues "wikilink") located behind the [nasal
cavity](nasal_cavity "wikilink"), in the roof of the
[nasopharynx](nasopharynx "wikilink"), where the
[nose](human_nose "wikilink") blends into the
[throat](throat "wikilink"). In [children](child "wikilink"), it
normally forms a soft mound in the roof and back wall of the
nasopharynx, just above and behind the
[uvula](palatine_uvula "wikilink").

The term *adenoid* is also used to represent [adenoid
hypertrophy](adenoid_hypertrophy "wikilink"), the abnormal growth of the
pharyngeal tonsils.[4]

## Structure

The adenoid is a mass of [lymphatic
tissue](Lymphatic_tissues "wikilink") located behind the nasal cavity,
in the roof of the [nasopharynx](nasopharynx "wikilink"), where the nose
blends into the throat. The adenoid, unlike the [palatine
tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink"), has [pseudostratified
epithelium](pseudostratified_epithelium "wikilink").[5] The adenoids are
part of the so-called [Waldeyer
ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink") of lymphoid tissue which
also includes the palatine tonsils, the [lingual
tonsils](lingual_tonsils "wikilink") and the [tubal
tonsils](tubal_tonsils "wikilink").

### Development

Adenoids develop from a subepithelial infiltration of
[lymphocytes](lymphocytes "wikilink") after the 16th week of embryonic
life. After birth, enlargement begins and continues until ages 5 to 7
years.

### Function

Part of the immune system, adenoids trap and recognize pathogens such as
bacteria and viruses. In response, the adenoid produces [T
cells](T_cell "wikilink") and [B cells](B_cell "wikilink") to combat
infection, contributing to the synthesis of IgA
[immunoglobulins](immunoglobulin "wikilink"), assisting in the body's
immunologic memory.[6]

### Microbiome

Species of bacteria such as [lactobacilli](lactobacilli "wikilink"),
anaerobic streptococci, [actinomycosis](actinomycosis "wikilink"),
[Fusobacterium](Fusobacterium "wikilink") species, and
[Nocardia](Nocardia "wikilink") are normally present by 6 months of age.
Normal flora found in the adenoid consists of [alpha-hemolytic
streptococci](alpha-hemolytic_streptococci "wikilink") and
[enterococci](enterococci "wikilink"),
[Corynebacterium](Corynebacterium "wikilink") species,
[coagulase-negative
staphylococci](coagulase-negative_staphylococci "wikilink"),
[Neisseria](Neisseria "wikilink") species,
[Haemophilus](Haemophilus "wikilink") species,
[Micrococcus](Micrococcus "wikilink") species, and
[Stomatococcus](Stomatococcus "wikilink") species.

## Clinical significance

### Enlargement

<img src="Adenoid_hypertrophy.jpg"
title="3D still showing adenoid hypertrophy." width="258" height="258"
alt="3D still showing adenoid hypertrophy." /> An enlarged adenoid, or
[adenoid hypertrophy](adenoid_hypertrophy "wikilink"), can become nearly
the size of a [ping pong ball](ping_pong_ball "wikilink") and completely
block airflow through the nasal passages. Even if the enlarged adenoid
is not substantial enough to physically block the back of the nose, it
can obstruct airflow enough so that breathing through the nose requires
an uncomfortable amount of work, and inhalation occurs instead through
an open mouth. The enlarged adenoid would also obstruct the nasal airway
enough to affect the voice without actually stopping nasal airflow
altogether.

Symptomatic enlargement between 18 and 24 months of age is not uncommon,
meaning that snoring, nasal airway obstruction and obstructed breathing
may occur during sleep. However, this may be reasonably expected to
decline when children reach school age, and progressive shrinkage may be
expected thereafter.

### Adenoid facies

Enlargement of the adenoid, especially in children, causes an atypical
appearance of the face, often referred to as *adenoid facies*.[7]
Features of adenoid facies include [mouth
breathing](mouth_breathing "wikilink"), an elongated face, prominent
incisors, [hypoplastic](hypoplastic "wikilink")
[maxilla](maxilla "wikilink"), short upper lip, elevated nostrils, and a
high arched palate.[8]

### Removal

Surgical removal of the adenoid is a procedure called
[adenoidectomy](adenoidectomy "wikilink"). Adenoid infection may cause
symptoms such as excessive [mucus](mucus "wikilink") production, which
can be treated by its removal. Studies have shown that adenoid regrowth
occurs in as many as 19% of the cases after removal.[9] Carried out
through the mouth under a [general
anaesthetic](general_anaesthetic "wikilink") (or less commonly a
[topical](topical_anesthetic "wikilink")), adenoidectomy involves the
adenoid being [curetted](curette "wikilink"),
[cauterized](cauterization "wikilink"),
[lasered](Laser_surgery "wikilink"), or otherwise
[ablated](Ablation#Medicine "wikilink"). The adenoid is often removed
along with the [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink").[10]

## See also

The **tubal tonsil,** also known as **Gerlach tonsil**, is one of the
four main [tonsil](tonsil "wikilink") groups forming [Waldeyer's
tonsillar ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink").

## Structure

Each tubal tonsil is located posterior to the opening of the [Eustachian
tube](Eustachian_tube "wikilink") on the lateral wall of the
[nasopharynx](nasopharynx "wikilink").[11] It is one of the four main
tonsil groups forming [Waldeyer's tonsillar
ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink").[12] This ring also includes
the [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink"), the [lingual
tonsils](lingual_tonsils "wikilink"), and the
[adenoid](adenoid "wikilink").[13]

## Clinical significance

The tubal tonsil may be affected by
[tonsillitis](tonsillitis "wikilink").[14] However, this usually affects
only the [palatine tonsils](Palatine_tonsil "wikilink").[15]

## History

The tubal tonsil may also be known as the Gerlach tonsil.[16] It is very
close to the [torus tubarius](torus_tubarius "wikilink"),[17] which is
why this tonsil is sometimes also called the *tonsil of (the) torus
tubarius*.[18] Equating the torus with its tonsil however might be seen
as incorrect or imprecise.

**Palatine tonsils**, commonly called the **tonsils** and occasionally
called the **faucial tonsils**,[19] are [tonsils](tonsils "wikilink")
located on the left and right sides at the back of the
[throat](throat "wikilink"), which can often be seen as flesh-colored,
pinkish lumps. Tonsils only present as "white lumps" if they are
inflamed or infected with symptoms of exudates (pus drainage) and severe
swelling.

[Tonsillitis](Tonsillitis "wikilink") is an
[inflammation](inflammation "wikilink") of the tonsils and will often,
but not necessarily, cause a sore throat and
[fever](fever "wikilink").[20] In
[chronic](Chronic_(medicine) "wikilink") cases,
[tonsillectomy](tonsillectomy "wikilink") may be indicated.[21]

## Structure

The palatine tonsils are located in the [isthmus of the
fauces](isthmus_of_the_fauces "wikilink"), between the [palatoglossal
arch](palatoglossal_arch "wikilink") and the [palatopharyngeal
arch](palatopharyngeal_arch "wikilink") of the [soft
palate](soft_palate "wikilink").

The palatine tonsil is one of the [mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissues](mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue "wikilink") (MALT), located
at the entrance to the upper respiratory and
[gastrointestinal](gastrointestinal "wikilink") tracts to protect the
body from the entry of exogenous material through mucosal sites.[22][23]
In consequence it is a site of, and potential focus for, infections, and
is one of the chief immunocompetent tissues in the
[oropharynx](oropharynx "wikilink"). It forms part of the [Waldeyer's
ring](Waldeyer's_ring "wikilink"), which comprises the
[adenoid](adenoid "wikilink"), the paired [tubal
tonsils](tubal_tonsil "wikilink"), the paired palatine tonsils and the
[lingual tonsils](lingual_tonsil "wikilink").[24] From the pharyngeal
side, they are covered with a [stratified squamous
epithelium](stratified_squamous_epithelium "wikilink"), whereas a
fibrous capsule links them to the wall of the pharynx. Through the
capsule pass trabecules that contain small blood vessels, nerves and
lymphatic vessels. These trabecules divide the tonsil into lobules.

### Blood supply and innervation

The nerves supplying the palatine tonsils come from the [maxillary
division](maxillary_nerve "wikilink") of the [trigeminal
nerve](trigeminal_nerve "wikilink") via the lesser palatine nerves, and
from the tonsillar branches of the [glossopharyngeal
nerve](glossopharyngeal_nerve "wikilink"). The glossopharyngeal nerve
continues past the palatine tonsil and innervates the posterior 1/3 of
the tongue to provide general and taste sensation.[25] This nerve is
most likely to be damaged during a
[tonsillectomy](tonsillectomy "wikilink"), which leads to reduced or
lost general sensation and taste sensation to the posterior third of the
tongue.[26][27]

Blood supply is provided by tonsillar branches of five arteries: the
[dorsal lingual artery](dorsal_lingual_artery "wikilink") (of the
[lingual artery](lingual_artery "wikilink")), [ascending palatine
artery](ascending_palatine_artery "wikilink") (of the [facial
artery](facial_artery "wikilink")), tonsillar branch (of the facial
artery), [ascending pharyngeal
artery](ascending_pharyngeal_artery "wikilink") (of the [external
carotid artery](external_carotid_artery "wikilink")), and the [lesser
palatine artery](lesser_palatine_artery "wikilink") (a branch of the
[descending palatine artery](descending_palatine_artery "wikilink"),
itself a branch of the [maxillary artery](maxillary_artery "wikilink")).
The tonsils venous drainage is by the [peritonsillar
plexus](peritonsillar_plexus "wikilink"), which drain into the lingual
and pharyngeal veins, which in turn drain into the [internal jugular
vein](internal_jugular_vein "wikilink").[28]

### Tonsillar crypts

title="Low-power microscope magnification of a cross-section through one of the tonsillar crypts (running diagonally) as it opens onto the surface of the throat (at the top). Stratified epithelium (e) covers the throat&#39;s surface and continues as a lining of the crypt. Beneath the surface are numerous nodules (f) of lymphoid tissue.

Many lymph cells (dark-colored region) pass from the nodules toward the surface and will eventually mix with the saliva as salivary corpuscles (s)." />
Palatine tonsils consist of approximately 15 crypts, which result in a
large internal surface. The tonsils contain four lymphoid compartments
that influence immune functions, namely the reticular crypt
[epithelium](epithelium "wikilink"), the
[extrafollicular](extrafollicular "wikilink") area, the mantle zones of
[lymphoid](lymphoid "wikilink") follicles, and the follicular germinal
centers. In human palatine tonsils, the very first part exposed to the
outside environment is tonsillar epithelium.[29]

## Function

### Local immunity

Tonsillar (relating to palatine tonsil) B cells can mature to produce
all the five major [immunoglobulin](Antibody "wikilink") (Ig, aka
antibody) classes.[30] Furthermore, when incubated in vitro with either
[mitogens](mitogens "wikilink") or specific
[antigens](antigens "wikilink"), they produce specific antibodies
against [diphtheria toxoid](diphtheria "wikilink"),
[poliovirus](poliovirus "wikilink"), [Streptococcus
pneumoniae](Streptococcus_pneumoniae "wikilink"), [Haemophilus
influenzae](Haemophilus_influenzae "wikilink"), [Staphylococcus
aureus](Staphylococcus_aureus "wikilink"), and the
[lipopolysaccharide](lipopolysaccharide "wikilink") of *E. coli*. Most
[Immunoglobulin A](IgA "wikilink") produced by tonsillar B cells in
vitro appears to be 7S monomers, although a significant proportion may
be l0S dimeric IgA.

In addition to humoral immunity elicited by tonsillar and
[adenoidal](adenoid "wikilink") B cells following antigenic stimulation,
there is considerable T-cell response in palatine tonsils.[31] Thus,
natural infection or intranasal immunization with live,
[attenuated](attenuator_(genetics) "wikilink")
[rubella](rubella "wikilink") virus vaccine has been reported to prime
tonsillar [lymphocytes](lymphocytes "wikilink") much better than
[subcutaneous](Subcutaneous_injection "wikilink") vaccination. Also,
natural infection with [varicella zoster
virus](varicella_zoster_virus "wikilink") has been found to stimulate
tonsillar lymphocytes better than lymphocytes from [peripheral
blood](Peripheral_blood_cell "wikilink").

### Cytokine action

[Cytokines](Cytokines "wikilink") are humoral
[immunomodulatory](immunomodulator "wikilink") proteins or
[glycoproteins](glycoproteins "wikilink") which control or modulate the
activities of target cells, resulting in gene activation, leading to
mitotic division, growth and differentiation, migration, or
[apoptosis](apoptosis "wikilink"). They are produced by wide range of
cell types upon antigen-specific and non-antigen specific stimuli. It
has been reported by many studies that the clinic outcome of many
infectious, [autoimmune](autoimmune "wikilink"), or malignant diseases
appears to be influenced by the overall balance of production (profiles)
of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore,
determination of cytokine profiles in tonsil study will provide key
information for further in-depth analysis of the cause and underlying
mechanisms of these disorders, as well as the role and possible
interactions between the T- and B-lymphocytes and other immunocompetent
cells.[32]

The cytokine network represents a very sophisticated and versatile
regulatory system that is essential to the immune system for overcoming
the various defense strategies of microorganisms. Through several
studies, the [Th1](T_helper_cell "wikilink") and [Th2](Th2 "wikilink")
cytokines and cytokine mRNA are both detectable in tonsillar hypertrophy
(or [obstructive sleep apnea](obstructive_sleep_apnea "wikilink"), OSA)
and recurrent [tonsillitis](tonsillitis "wikilink") groups. It showed
that human palatine tonsil is an active immunological organ containing a
wide range of cytokine-producing cells. Both Th1 and Th2 cells are
involved in the [pathophysiology](pathophysiology "wikilink") of TH and
RT conditions. Indeed, human tonsils persistently harbor
[microbial](microbial "wikilink") antigens even when the subject is
asymptomatic of ongoing infection. It could also be an effect of
ontogeny of the immune system.

## Clinical significance

The pathogenesis of infectious/inflammatory disease in the tonsils most
likely has its basis in their anatomic location and their inherent
function as organ of immunity, processing infectious material, and other
antigens and then becoming, paradoxically, a focus of
infection/inflammation. No single theory of pathogenesis has yet been
accepted, however. Viral infection with secondary bacterial invasion may
be one mechanism of the initiation of chronic disease,[33] but the
effects of the environment, host factors, the widespread use of
antibiotics, ecological considerations, and diet all may play a
role.[34] A recent cross-sectional study revealed a high rate of
prevalent virus infections in non-acutely ill patients undergoing
routine tonsillectomy. However, none of the 27 detected viruses showed
positive association to the tonsillar disease.[35]

In children, the tonsils are common sites of infections that may give
rise to acute or chronic tonsillitis. However, it is still an open
question whether tonsillar hypertrophy is also caused by a persistent
infection. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common major operations
performed on children. The indications for the operation have been
complicated by the controversy over the benefits of removing a
chronically infected tissue and the possible harm caused by eliminating
an important immune inductive tissue.[36][37]

The information that is necessary to make a rational decision to resolve
this controversy can be obtained by understanding the immunological
potential of the normal palatine tonsils and comparing these functions
with the changes that occur in the chronically diseased counterparts.

### Acute tonsillitis

![A medical animation still that shows
tonsillitis.](SAG_Acute-Tonsillitis_191010_01_(1).jpg "A medical animation still that shows tonsillitis.")
[Tonsillitis](Tonsillitis "wikilink") is the inflammation of tonsils.
Acute tonsillitis is the most common manifestation of tonsillar disease.
It is associated with sore throat, fever and [difficulty
swallowing](dysphagia "wikilink").[38] The tonsils may appear normal
sized or enlarged but are usually erythematous. Often, but not always,
[exudates](exudate "wikilink") can be seen. Not all these signs and
symptoms are present in every patient.

### Recurrent tonsillitis

Recurrent infection has been variably defined as from four to seven
episodes of acute tonsillitis in one year, five episodes for two
consecutive years or three episodes per year for 3 consecutive
years.[39][40]

### Tonsillar hypertrophy

Tonsillar hypertrophy is the enlargement of the tonsils, but without the
history of inflammation. Obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy is currently
the most common reason for tonsillectomy.[41] These patients present
with varying degrees of disturbed sleep which may include symptoms of
loud snoring, irregular breathing, nocturnal choking and coughing,
frequent awakenings, [sleep apnea](sleep_apnea "wikilink"),
[dysphagia](dysphagia "wikilink") and/or daytime hypersomnolence. These
may lead to behavioral/mood changes in patients and facilitate the need
for a [polysomnography](polysomnography "wikilink") in order to
determine the degree to which these symptoms are disrupting their
sleep.[42][43]

Advanced Special characters Help Cite The **lingual tonsils** are a
collection of [lymphatic tissue](Lymphatic_tissues "wikilink") located
in the lamina propria of the root of the
[tongue](tongue "wikilink").[44] This lymphatic tissue consists of the
lymphatic nodules rich in cells of the [immune
system](immune_system "wikilink")
([immunocytes](immunocyte "wikilink")).[45] The immunocytes initiate the
immune response when the lingual tonsils get in contact with invading
[microorganisms](microorganism "wikilink")
([pathogenic](pathogenic "wikilink") [bacteria](bacteria "wikilink"),
[viruses](viruses "wikilink") or
[parasites](Human_parasite "wikilink")).[46][47][48]

## Structure

### Microanatomy

Lingual tonsils are covered externally by stratified squamous
nonkeratinized epithelium that invaginates inward forming crypts.
Beneath the epithelium is a layer of lymphoid nodules containing
lymphocytes. [Mucous glands](Mucous_gland "wikilink") located at the
root of tongue are drained through several ducts into the crypt of
lingual tonsils.[49][50] Secretions of these mucous glands keep the
crypt clean and free of any debris.

### Blood supply

Lingual tonsils are located on posterior aspect of tongue which is
supplied through:[51]

-   Lingual artery, branch of external carotid artery
-   Tonsillar branch of facial artery
-   Ascending and descending palatine arteries
-   Ascending pharyngeal branch of external carotid artery

### Nerve supply

Lingual tonsils are innervated by tonsillar nerves from the tonsilar
plexus, formed by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.[52]

## Function

<img src="Blausen_0861_Tonsils&amp;Throat_Anatomy2.png"
title="Tonsils and the throat–lingual tonsils labelled" width="240"
alt="Tonsils and the throat–lingual tonsils labelled" /> Like other
lymphatic tissues, the function of lingual tonsils is to prevent
infections. These tonsils contain B and T lymphocytes which get
activated when harmful bacteria and viruses come in contact with
tonsils. B lymphocytes kill pathogens by producing antibodies against
them, while T lymphocytes directly kill them releasing cytotoxic
substances or indirectly by stimulating other cells of the immune
system.[53][54][55]

## Clinical significance

### Cancer

[Squamous cell](Squamous_cell "wikilink") carcinoma is a type of
neoplasm that can affect lingual tonsils.[56]

### Sleep apnea

Enlarged or hypertrophic lingual tonsils have the potential to cause or
exacerbate sleep apnea.[57]
