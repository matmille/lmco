Effective leadership at Lockheed Martin isn’t only about getting results. 
It’s about getting results in the right way. Our leaders are expected to 
continually promote ethical behavior, support diversity and make decisions
that protect the health and safety of employees as well as the natural
environment through Full Spectrum Leadership.

Ultimately, every one of us is a leader, because we all control the 
attitudes and behaviors of at least one person - ourself - and we set 
an example for our colleagues. Lockheed Martin is striving to establish 
the tools and reinforce the values that provide everyone with rewarding 
work in a safe and supportive environment. But it’s up to each one of 
us as individuals to embrace the culture we’re creating.

The **tonsils** are a set of [lymphoid](Lymphatic_system "wikilink")
organs facing into the aerodigestive tract, which is known as
[Waldeyer's tonsillar ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink") and
consists of the [adenoid tonsil](adenoid "wikilink") (or pharyngeal
tonsil), two [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsil "wikilink"), two [palatine
tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink"), and the [lingual
tonsils](lingual_tonsil "wikilink"). These organs play an important role
in the immune system.
